         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Poſitively what they were; namely, an apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of more purity in Aſſemblies and Ordinances. Secondly, <q>Under what <hi>condition</hi> I deſire to be taken on, <hi>ſcil.</hi> of a profeſſion, 1. Of my acknowledgement of the <hi>Authority of Magiſtracy over all perſons</hi> in Civil Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. 2. In <hi>Church matters,</hi> for the point of <hi>publick</hi> exerciſe, ſo, as not to raiſe tumults, and by force to obtain the exerciſe of Religion, 3.

                  <p>Now this is not anſwered in my judgment, by a ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of a Private<note n="*" place="margin">Fleta. lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>17.</hi> de juſtitiariis ſubſtituendis.</note> Lawyer, that, <hi>Rex habet in populo regendo ſuperiores, legem per quam factus eſt, &amp; curiam

                     </q> For the King having both conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſworn to the Laws, and to the maintaining the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of his Courts acting according to thoſe Laws, is not now in that reſpect <hi>ſui juris,</hi> and arbitrary in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but obliged both to God and man to act by Laws, and to preſerve his Courts unviolate. But if any Court ſhall aſſume a greater power than the King and Law hath given them, or act in oppoſition to that power from whom they had their being, whilſt he doth not open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reject all Laws and Government, much leſs when he doth rationally, together with as many or more, both of Lords and Commons (though excluded the formality of being in ſuch a place) judge, that he acts according to Law in the main of his proceedings: In ſuch caſe, and in ſuch actings, they are not ſuch a Court, nor are not authoriſed with <hi>power</hi> from above, but act excentrically, and as <hi>private</hi> perſons, unto whom the Declaration grants the King to be ſuperior.

                     <q>That they were <hi>entrusted</hi> with power for the Kingdoms preſervation; and that, the Parliament degenerating, they muſt not ſee the Kingdom periſh.</q>

Or to ſpeak yet more properly, The Parliament, that is, the King, Lords and Commons; for the Parliament is not without the King, as being the <hi>Head</hi> of it; but without, and in oppoſition unto him and the Laws, they do not take ſuch cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Again, for that ſaying, <q>That they might much more take account of the Kings actions, that are done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the authority of any Court; meaning the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and the raiſing of <hi>Arms:</hi>
                     </q> Seeing no Court is ſuperior to its Author, the King; therefore no Court can give authority to him, but he to them; nor can they call him to account, for then they were his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors, and had the Regal Power, and himſelf ſhould be no King, as is expreſly affirm'd in Mr. <hi>St. John</hi>'s ſpeech againſt <hi>Ship-mony,</hi> of which afterward.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Laſtly, How can this be aſſented unto, that becauſe when the Title is dubious,<note place="margin">Ibid. pag. ult.</note> he is to be accepted for King whom the two Houſes declare to be ſo, by the Statute of 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. that therefore much more they may judge in the great queſtion, what is the beſt ſervice of the

Secondly, when there is no King actually, their power may be more, as the wife that hath no husband. Thirdly, The Declaration of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth not give the King his title or authority; but onely declares, recognizeth, and acknowledges, that he had it before.

                  </head>
                  <p>THeir ſecond is about the nature of <hi>Tyranny.</hi> They ſay; it is <hi>not</hi> Gods Ordinance, and therefore not 'commanded to be obeyed by the <hi>Apoſtle, Rom.</hi> 13. nor by <hi>reaſon,</hi> 
                     <q>becauſe there is no rational tye by Law; they are a terror to the good, and tend to the <hi>ſubverſion</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> overthrow of <hi>Religion, Laws,</hi> and <hi>Liberty.</hi>
                     </q> But firſt they ſhould remember, that although a moral <hi>evil</hi> in any kind be not Gods Ordinance, yet the <hi>application</hi> of it may, and often is Gods Ordinance. As the ſetting of <hi>Satan</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe his malice upon men, and upon his own elect ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for their trial and humiliation, as he did upon <hi>Job;</hi> and the ſetting up a <hi>King</hi> in his wrath,<note place="margin">Job 1.</note> as we ſaw above; and the ſetting of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> over the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> to whom he gave no power of reſiſtance, though they were not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                     <hi>properly</hi> ſubjects. Secondly, though <hi>Tyranny</hi> be not Gods Ordinance, yet the <hi>Subjection</hi> to it is his Ordinance. Was not the invaſion of <hi>Ceſar,</hi> and reign of <hi>Caligula, Nero,</hi> and others, a Tyranny, and yet the Apoſtle ſaith, Obedience to it was Gods Ordinance, and for their good. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Though Tyranny be not Gods Ordinance, yet <hi>Government</hi> is, though tyrannically exerciſed, which <hi>good</hi> there is almoſt in all Tyrannies. Yea and as was
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:40898:56"/> ſaid before, Government Tyrannical is Gods Ordinance by way of <hi>puniſhment</hi> and animadverſion, he being Gods Miniſter to execute wrath, even <hi>Gods</hi> wrath,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> not onely upon them that <hi>do,</hi> but thoſe that <hi>have</hi> done evil; as alſo for the <hi>tryal</hi> of the faith and patience of his <hi>Saints</hi> for <hi>well-doing.</hi>

                  <p>THe fourth miſtake of the former Authors, is, that they diſtinguiſh in this queſtion betwixt a <hi>Parliament,</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> or inferior <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> and <hi>private</hi> perſons; granting defence unto the one, though denyed unto the other, and ſo would avoid the <hi>Scriptures</hi> as well as <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> prohibition, not to reſiſt the <hi>higher powers.</hi> But firſt, they ſay, <q>that a private perſon is not prohibited reſiſtance, but for want of ſtrength, ſo not for conſcience ſake;
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40898:58"/> a vile poſition.</q> If the power in a <hi>Parliament,</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> or inferior <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> be derived from a <hi>Superior,</hi> they have no power to uſe it againſt him, for it is <hi>his,</hi> and theirs onely by <hi>conceſſion</hi> from him; nor is it conferred on them, but with that intention for his ſervice, not his oppoſition. If they uſe it againſt him, it muſt be by ſome <hi>other ſuperior power</hi> that hath conferred other powers upon them (and that muſt be ſome viſible one too) for their very <hi>eſſe</hi> and <hi>being, as ſuch,</hi> a Parliament, State, or Magiſtracy, is wholly <hi>dependent</hi> from him, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred thoſe powers upon them. This for <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Then for the <hi>Scripture</hi> they would ſo elude, by ſaying, That it doth not forbid the <hi>Senate</hi> to reſiſt, if it did prohibit pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons, becauſe neither <hi>Paul</hi> nor <hi>Peter</hi> wrote to them, not being Chriſtians.

But the <hi>Independency</hi> here oppoſed, is that; whereby Chriſtians being before incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated as members into Congregations (ſuch as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alſo acknowledged to be true Chriſtian Churches and bodies of <hi>Chriſt</hi>) do read off themſelves, and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate into new ones of their own, for the moſt part ſmall and inconſiderable. For the detecting further of which error, we are to note one or two particulars. Firſt,<note place="margin">Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal power may be loſt.</note> we muſt diſtinguiſh between the <hi>original</hi> ſtate of a Church, as it might be at its firſt collection, and the <hi>after-condition</hi> of it, and <hi>preſent</hi> being. When it was firſt ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered it might be free, as was the family of <hi>Jethro;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Numb. 10.</note> but not ſo afterward, when incorporated with another Church. All the ſeveral <hi>Heptarchies</hi> in this Nation, and many Provinces elſe-where, were once free and <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent;</hi> doth it follow they muſt be ſo ſtill, or rend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the Kingdom, if they could, to be ſo again? By this, the 120 names that were the Church in the beginning, ſhould ſtill have aſſumed their firſt liberty.<note place="margin">Act. 1.</note> For we muſt note, that Eccleſiaſtical power, is as well <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſable</hi> as civil, and may be loſt (ſo, as it is not lawful to reſume it) and that not only by a voluntary conceſſion, or providential falling in with other Chriſtians, or Churches; but even by <hi>force</hi> alſo. As if by publick Edict, two or more Churches ſhould be conſtrained to unite into one.

The Arguments touching the former are: Firſt, from the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and <hi>order</hi> of this Oath. The ſecond from the <hi>power</hi> impoſing of it; The third from the <hi>matter</hi> of the oath it ſelf; The laſt from the <hi>ſcope and end</hi> of its framing and impoſing. Firſt, from the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>order</hi> of this Oath. When there are <hi>two</hi> oaths touching the <hi>ſame</hi> things, and they <hi>contradictory</hi> one to another; if the <hi>former be lawful</hi> and obliging, the latter cannot be ſo too, but void and null, <hi>ipſo facto.</hi> Hence it is, that <hi>our Apoſtle</hi> proveth the invalidity of the <hi>Ceremonial Law</hi> and Covenant being different from, and in ſome ſort op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the Covenant of <hi>Grace,</hi> becauſe it was made four hundred years after, and ſo could not make the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:40898:93"/> other void. So this Oath and Covenant, whereof we now ſpeak, being contradictory (as ſhall be ſeen, and is evident of it ſelf) to former <hi>lawful Oaths</hi> and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements confirmed by the <hi>Laws</hi> of the Kingdome, (as the Oath of <hi>Allegiance, Supremacy, Canonical Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Subſcriptions</hi> to the three <hi>Articles,</hi> and <hi>Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>) cannot make thoſe former of none effect; and is therefore void being taken, as it was unlawful to take it, unleſs the Obligation of the former Oaths and Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments had been by the <hi>ſame,</hi> or <hi>ſuperiour</hi> power relaxed. As was done by <hi>Hermannus</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Cullen</hi> to his ſubjects,<note place="margin">Sleid. Com. l. <hi>18</hi> Ad Ann. <hi>1547.</hi>
                        </note> when he was no longer able to protect them. Which was not our caſe. Our former Oaths and Engagements were agreeable to Law and Equity, both in their <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>authority</hi> injoyning them. This contradictory to them, and by an <hi>inferiour</hi> power, yea, by ſuch a power as had <hi>not</hi> authority to do it; which brings me to the <hi>ſecond</hi> Argument;<note place="margin">2. Arg. Becauſe it was in poſed by unſufficient power, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the lawful authority.</note> namely, taken from the <hi>power,</hi> or rather the <hi>impotency</hi> of the impoſers, as to this act. It is proved above, that in the Government, the <hi>King is Supreme</hi> by the Laws. But if he were but equal; yet in a <hi>coordinate</hi> power; if when one deſires to do his duty, and is well <hi>able</hi> thereunto; the other ſhall exclude him, and act in oppoſition, not only to him, but alſo to the <hi>Laws</hi> eſtabliſhed by <hi>all;</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon the Subjects, who are not obliged but as it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from <hi>all;</hi> to ſubmit and to accept of ſuch impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, if voluntarily, is a threefold iniquity and <hi>inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</hi> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, Unto the perſon <hi>excluded</hi> againſt his will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and right. Secondly, Againſt the <hi>liberty</hi> of the Subject, who is not liable to injunctions proceeding from ſome, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> but all. Thirdly, Againſt the <hi>priviledge</hi> of that body and government, which is, that <hi>every member</hi> and <hi>ſtate of it</hi> is to act <hi>together with the reſt.</hi> For the perſon now excluded, may perhaps afterward by power or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy get the power to him, and then exerciſe that <hi>arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> power on the other and the people, without the tother. Now apply this: If the two Houſes (ſuppoſing them
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:40898:93"/> to be ſuch) have power to impoſe Oaths under penalties upon the people; then hath the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Lords</hi> without the <hi>Commons;</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> without the <hi>Lords.</hi> By which it appeareth, that voluntary taking of ſuch an Oath, doth betray the Prerogative of the King, the priviledge of Parliam. and the liberty of the people. Seeing two powers, if coordinate, cannot countervene, what is done and eſtabliſhed for Law by all, (much leſs where one is Supreme to the other two) So that the former Oaths and Proteſtations, engaging for the maintenance of the <hi>Kings Prerogative,</hi> the <hi>privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges</hi> of <hi>Parliam.</hi> and the <hi>liberties of the Subject;</hi> makes this Oath and Covenant come clearly within the Verge of <hi>Perjury</hi> (ſo far as I can underſtand) as well as <hi>Treachery,</hi> to all the three premiſed intereſts.

                     </q> Thus far he.

                     <q>When ſuch queſtions ariſe among Schollars,<note place="margin">pag. 40.</note> the quieteſt proceeding were, to determine them in the <hi>Univerſities,</hi> and not to ſtuff the <hi>Book</hi> (of Articles) with all concluſions Theological.

                     <q>Unleſs (ſaith he) a man be born of water and of the holy Ghoſt, &amp;c.

I am not ignorant, that <hi>Adoption</hi> is made an effect or <hi>conſequent</hi> of our <hi>Juſtification</hi> and forgiveneſs of ſins. But if we conſider, that we muſt have <hi>union</hi> with Chriſt, before
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:40898:139"/> we can have communion; and that this communion effects firſt our <hi>regeneration</hi> and being born to God; we ſhall ſee that remiſſion of ſin is conſequent, as an effect thereof. We receive it by and from the blood of Chriſt, but by the medium of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> this blood being ſprinkled actually on none but thoſe that are <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate,</hi> at leaſt <hi>ſacramentally,</hi> and in reſpect of the <hi>outward application</hi> of the <hi>Covenant</hi> of grace; in which reſpect, all the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (after Circumciſion,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.11.</note> which was the ſeal of the righteouſneſs of faith) were owned by God as <hi>regenerate</hi> perſons, were his children, and had the <hi>priviledge</hi> of children, the <hi>remiſſion</hi> of ſins.

But that the Church aſcribeth forgivneſs of ſins, even in this form of Baptiſm, to the <hi>blood of Chriſt</hi> onely, appears in the prayer immediately <hi>before</hi> the act of Baptizing, which runs thus: <q>Almighty and everliving God, whoſe moſt dearly beloved Son Jeſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Prayer before Baptiſm.</note> for the forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our ſins, did ſhed out of his moſt pretious ſide both water and blood, &amp;c.</q> Then the Church ſhews <hi>how</hi> this regeneration is wrought,<note place="margin">Prayer after.</note> and what is the conſequent of it, in the prayer <hi>after</hi> Baptiſm; namely, <q>We yield thee hearty thinks, moſt merciful Father,<note place="margin">See the Artic. of Relig. 27. of Bapt.</note> that it hath pleaſed thee to regenerate this Infant with thy <hi>holy Spirit</hi> (Baptiſm is but the <hi>inſtrument</hi>) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him for thine own child by Adoption, (ſee, <hi>Adoption</hi> follows <hi>Regeneration</hi>) and to <hi>incorporate</hi> him, &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is uſual in Sacramental ſpeech, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the cauſe by the name of the effect, (and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily) by a Metonymie; as,<note place="margin">Matth. 27.</note> 
                     <q>This <hi>Cup</hi> is the New-Teſtament:
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:40898:140"/> Circumciſion is the Covenant:<note place="margin">Gen. 17.</note> This bread is my body.</q> So here, <hi>ſpiritual Regeneration</hi> is <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> in the meaning of the <hi>Prayer,</hi> by a Metonymie of the effect for the cauſe, becauſe Baptiſm is the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental cauſe of Regeneration. So that the meaning is but this: That the child may, by <hi>Baptiſm</hi> (called ſpiritual Regeneration,<note place="margin">Tit. 3.</note> as the Apoſtle calls it the <hi>Laver of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation</hi>) receive forgiveneſs of ſins, as in Scripture that benefit is properly affixed, <hi>firſt</hi> unto Baptiſm; as: <q>Be ye baptized for the remiſſion of ſins.<note place="margin">Act. 2.</note> And, Ariſe and be baptiſed, and waſh away thy ſins. And, They were baptized,<note place="margin">Matth. 3.</note> confeſſing their ſins; that is, in order to their waſhing away by Baptiſm.</q> But this derogates nothing from the <hi>blood of Christ,</hi> by vertue whereof (as being the ordinance and inſtrument of its application) Baptiſm or ſpiritual Regeneration, doth produce re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins. As for that reproach the Brethren caſt upon this expreſſion, as if it were <hi>mans falſhood,</hi> rather than <hi>Gods truth;</hi> it ſavours of an affectation, rather not to looſe ſomewhat an elegant expreſſion, than to receive the <hi>truth</hi> in the love of it, ſo pertinently held forth in that expreſſion.

And my ſelf knew a man, that would therefore pay no rent to his Landlord, ſaying; Why ſhould not he have a houſe as well as he.

Now when the Law of any Nation hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſuch a puniſhment, neceſſarily to be inflicted upon ſuch a Malefactor, he may upon this ground ſay: <q>The kind of puniſhment is indifferent, and no Law of man can make that neceſſary without injuſtice.</q> It

                     </q> But do theſe things prove, that things indifferent may not by <hi>Authority</hi> be made neceſſary as to practiſe? Nothing leſs. For, the things the Apoſtle mentioneth, were, as to any publick <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>

In Baptiſm I <hi>baptize</hi> thee in the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not a <hi>praying</hi> that hee may be baptized.

                        <note place="margin">Act. 22.16.</note> which is <hi>Magiſterial</hi> and commanding. At the leaſt it is an uſing of the <hi>very words of Chriſt himſelf at the firſt institution,</hi> as neer as may bee, which the Brethren de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to be lawful. So in the <hi>Lords Supper:</hi> It is <hi>not,</hi> in the very act: I <hi>pray</hi> that thou mayeſt be one for whom Chriſt died, and that thou mayeſt feed on him by Faith: But a <hi>peremptory</hi> aſſertion, that Chriſt died for him, and an <hi>imperative</hi> command that hee ſhould <hi>feed on him by Faith.</hi> In neither the one Sacrament nor the other, is there a <hi>prayer</hi> uſed in the very act of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring. Neither were it unlawful if the former were in the Lords Supper, <hi>Take thou the body of Chriſt, take thou his blood,</hi> which ſome have uſed, But that
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:40898:195"/> our Church for the avoiding of <hi>Superſtition</hi> hath been forced to uſe other words. The <hi>Germane</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Churches uſe a form not unlike that now named. The <hi>Dutch:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Form of the Lords Supper in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Churches.</note> The bread which wee break is the communion of <hi>the body of Chriſt, take and eat it:</hi> where they are <hi>commanded</hi> to take the <hi>body</hi> of Chriſt, as peremptorily, as the Miniſter is commanded to <hi>take the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> So in the Cup.

                  <head>III. An Evidence further of the ſincerity of my own.</head>
                  <p>For the Truth of my Return unto the Church, take part of a Letter written to a dying friend, and neer rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Octob.</hi> 8. 60. Immediately after my recovery from my dangerous ſickneſs above mentioned (the rather, becauſe the matter may do good to ſome others alſo) the words were theſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>—<q>The next thing I would remember you of, is; that you have according to the courſe of this world, lived in Schiſm, and ſeparation from the Church, your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and the Ordinances of God in the place where you live, and particularly from the holy Communion. Remember what the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.30. For this cauſe many are weak and ſickly among you, and many are dead. If the prophanation, then the <hi>total neglect</hi> of the Sacrament (which argues a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of it) is often puniſhed in this manner. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this, and ſee the Exhortations before the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book;</hi> where you ſhall ſee more of the danger of the neglect of this Ordinance. Neither is <hi>Schiſm,</hi> and withdrawing our ſelves from the Church, in the place wherein wee live, and the Miniſtry and Ordinances there, a <hi>ſmall</hi> ſin. For it is a rending and defiling, and deſtroying of that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and Church of God. Now the puniſhment is: If any man defile or deſtroy (ſo it is in the Margin of your Bible) the Temple of God, him will God deſtroy, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 3.17. God is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying of you in the midſt of your years, and this is your ſin. Your Example makes other ſtones of the ſpiritual building (as one peece in a houſe fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, makes way for another) fall off too. If all ſhould do ſo, God ſhould have no Church, no Miniſtry, no Worſhip in that place. Your <hi>Father</hi> did not ſo, but waited humbly on God in his Ordinances, and made uſe of ſuch Miniſtry as God ſent (though ſometimes
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:40898:210"/> mean, and none of the beſt) and encouraged them. What is it then? Firſt ask the <hi>Lord</hi> earneſt pardon. Next go and bee <hi>reconciled to your</hi>
